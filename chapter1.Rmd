# Chapter 1: Introduction to Open Data Science
<br>
  
In this course, we will learn to take advantage of the basic tools of **open data science**. They include:

* *R*
* *RStudio*
* *R Markdown*
* *GitHub*

<br>

My first thoughts when I found this course:

> I have been looking for something like this.

**Datacamp** also seems like a nice learning platform becaue R is used through the browser and you can get immediate feedback.

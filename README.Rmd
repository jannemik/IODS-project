# Introduction to Open data science (IODS)

Hello! I chose this course because it seemed like a great opportunity to learn the basic work process of open data science. I have been doing statistical analysis for many years, but I felt that learning to use **R** would greatly benefit my work. Now that I have also taken my first steps with **GitHub**, I can say that it seems like a nice way to keep track of different versions of code when doing statistical analysis.
